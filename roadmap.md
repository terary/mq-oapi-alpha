In terms of decoupling, coupled, loosely coupled etc, this is best described as **entangled**

The work required to make it well organized far outweighs the work required to do it right from scratch.

The basic concepts demonstrate here should be useful for development of other projects.

This was only meant to be a proof of concept and as such - it fulfills the goals 

Moving forward:
    + utilize sequelize and several db interfaces
    + use typescript  (maybe)
    + design develop separate projects: 
        monqade-express 
        OAPIDocumenter 
        WebMethods (maybe)
    + make sure (before starting) - conceptualize how monqade-express, OAPIDocumenter 
      and WebMethods will play together and well as separately.
